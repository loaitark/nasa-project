# nasa-project
The project goal: to build a Node API that allows users to schedule missions with the destination being a habitable Kepler Exoplanet.

So far, I've learned

asynchronous JavaScript concepts (e.g., promises and async await)
Node.js fundamentals (e.g., module system and package management)
back-end concepts (e.g., HTTP methods, requests and responses, and routing)
how to leverage Express.js to handle requests in a modular structure
